# Design Patterns

Generally speaking, there are three main categories of Design Patterns. They are:
  - Creational Patterns
  - Structural Patterns - 
 Use structural patterns to describe how different objects have a relationship (how they interact with each other). Also, how they should work to achieve a particular goal (how spicy and ingredients work to create a dish)
  - Behavioral Patterns -
It defines how objects distribute work, how an object performs a single cohesive function and how different/independent objects work towards a common goal. (Race team trying to win the race).

## Creational Pattern
### Singleton

### Factory Method Pattern

* What is a factory?
Generally, a factory is a method or an object that creates other objects.

Factories allow the client code operates on generalization. It is called code to

**Benefits of Factory Objects**
If there are multiple clients that want to instantiate the same set of classes, then by using the Factory Method pattern we cut out the redundancy of code and made the code easier to modify (add more type of classes that can be instantiated)
